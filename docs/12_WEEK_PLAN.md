# 12-Week Transformation Plan: 73kg to Muscular

This plan follows a **Body Recomposition** strategy: building the upper body to balance your frame while leaning out the thighs through Zone 2 running and progressive bodyweight volume.

## 🗓️ Phase 1: The Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
*Goal: Master form, establish the 3-1-1 tempo, and wake up the muscles.*

| Day | Activity | Exercise Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mon/Wed/Fri** | **Full Body A** | Incline Push-ups, Doorway Rows, Air Squats, Plank |
| **Tue/Thu/Sat** | **Cardio/Lean** | 20 min Zone 2 Run (Keep pace easy) |
| **Sun** | **Recovery** | Long walk + 3L Water |

**Progression Goal:** Move from 8 reps to 15 reps of Incline Push-ups with perfect control.

---

## 🗓️ Phase 2: Tension & Shape (Weeks 5-8)
*Goal: Increase resistance by changing angles. Target the "V-Taper" and Thigh Toning.*

| Day | Activity | Exercise Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mon/Fri** | **Upper Focus** | Floor Push-ups, Table Rows (Under table), Diamond Push-ups |
| **Wed** | **Lower Focus** | Reverse Lunges, Glute Bridges, Wall Sits (1 min) |
| **Tue/Thu** | **Cardio/Lean** | 30 min Zone 2 Run |
| **Sat** | **Active** | 45 min brisk walk or light jog |
| **Sun** | **Recovery** | Mobility/Stretching |

**Progression Goal:** Master the "Table Row"—this is the key move for that wide back that makes your lower body look smaller.

## 🗓️ Phase 3: The Sculpt (Weeks 9-12)
*Goal: Maximum muscle stimulus. High volume and advanced variations.*

| Day | Activity | Exercise Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mon** | **Push/Pull** | Archer Push-ups (Wide), Under-Table Rows, Incline Dips |
| **Wed** | **Leg Sculpt** | Bulgarian Split Squats (Foot on chair), Calf Raises |
| **Fri** | **Full Body Max** | Floor Push-ups (to failure), Plank Walk-outs, Split Squats |
| **Tue/Thu/Sat** | **Fat Burn** | 35 min Zone 2 Run (Steady pace) |
| **Sun** | **Full Rest** | Relax & Meal Prep |

**Progression Goal:** Complete 3 sets of 10 Bulgarian Split Squats. This move is the "King" of leaning out the thighs while building athletic glutes.

## 🥗 Nutrition Roadmap (Adjusting as you go)
*   **Weeks 1-4:** Focus on **120g Protein** and **3L Water**. Don't worry about total calories yet.
*   **Weeks 5-8:** Keep protein high. Start reducing "Liquid Calories" (sodas/juices) to accelerate thigh leaning.
*   **Weeks 9-12:** Maintenance calories. High protein, high water. This is where you'll see the 73kg look completely different in the mirror.

*   **Week 5:** The app automatically swaps "Incline Push-ups" for "Floor Push-ups" in your tracker.

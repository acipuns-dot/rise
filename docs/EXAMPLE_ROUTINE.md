## ⏱️ The Secret Ingredient: The 3-1-1 Tempo
To grow muscle without weights, you must control the movement:
1. **3 Seconds Down** (Slow and controlled)
2. **1 Second Pause** at the bottom (Feel the stretch)
3. **1 Second Up** (Explosive power)

---

## 🟢 Part 1: Warm-up (5 Minutes)
Keep your joints safe and get blood flowing.
- **Arm Circles:** 20 reps (10 forward, 10 backward)
- **Leg Swings:** 15 reps per leg (Hold a wall for balance)
- **Cat-Cow Stretch:** 10 reps (Mobilize the spine)
- **Jumping Jacks:** 30 seconds (Raise the heart rate)

---

## 🔥 Part 2: The Main Event (3 Sets per Exercise)
Rest **60-90 seconds** between sets.

### 1. The PUSH (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)
*Focus: Broadening the upper body to balance your frame.*
- **Exercise:** **Incline Push-ups** (Hands on your bed, sofa, or a sturdy desk)
- **Reps:** 8 to 12
- **Note:** Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.

### 2. The PULL (Back and Biceps)
*Focus: The "V-Taper" back to make the waist/thighs look smaller.*
- **Exercise:** **Doorway Rows** (Stand in a doorway, grab the frame, and pull your chest toward it)
- **Reps:** 10 to 15
- **Alternative:** **Under-Table Rows** (Lying under a sturdy table, pulling chest to table edge).

### 3. The LOWER (Quads, Glutes, Hamstrings)
*Focus: Toning and leaning the thighs.*
- **Exercise:** **Reverse Lunges**
- **Reps:** 12 per leg
- **Note:** Don't rush. Sink deep and feel the glute (butt) working to pull you back up. This "lifts" the leg rather than bulking the front of the thigh.

### 4. The CORE (Abs and Stability)
- **Exercise:** **High Plank** (Top of a push-up position)
- **Duration:** Hold for 30–45 seconds.
- **Note:** Squeeze your glutes and belly button. Don't let your back arch.

---

## 🏃 Part 3: Running (Non-Workout Days)
- **Duration:** 20–30 Minutes.
- **Pace:** "Conversation Pace" (Zone 2). You should be able to speak a full sentence without gasping for air. 
- **Goal:** Burn fat in the lower body and improve recovery.

---

## 🧘 Part 4: Cool-Down (3 Minutes)
- **Chest Stretch:** (Using a wall doorway) - 30s per side.
- **Quad Stretch:** (Standing, pulling foot to glute) - 30s per side.
- **Child's Pose:** 1 Minute.

## 📈 How to "Level Up"
Once you can do **3 sets of 12 reps** perfectly with the 3-1-1 tempo:
1. **Push:** Move from Incline Push-ups to **Floor Push-ups**.
2. **Pull:** Pull your body closer to the doorway or move to the Table.
3. **Legs:** Put your back foot on a chair for **Bulgarian Split Squats**.
